what are the genetic changes related to acral peeling skin syndrome,acral peeling skin syndrome is caused by mutations in the tgm5 gene this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called transglutaminase 5 which is a component of the outer layer of skin the epidermis transglutaminase 5 plays a critical role in the formation of a structure called the cornified cell envelope which surrounds epidermal cells and helps the skin form a protective barrier between the body and its environment tgm5 gene mutations reduce the production of transglutaminase 5 or prevent cells from making any of this protein a shortage of transglutaminase 5 weakens the cornified cell envelope which allows the outermost cells of the epidermis to separate easily from the underlying skin and peel off this peeling is most noticeable on the hands and feet probably because those areas tend to be heavily exposed to moisture and friction
what are the genetic changes related to adcy5related dyskinesia,as its name suggests adcy5related dyskinesia is caused by mutations in the adcy5 gene this gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called adenylate cyclase 5 this enzyme helps convert a molecule called adenosine triphosphate atp to another molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp atp is a molecule that supplies energy for cells activities including muscle contraction and camp is involved in signaling for many cellular functions some adcy5 gene mutations that cause adcy5related dyskinesia are thought to increase adenylate cyclase 5 enzyme activity and the level of camp within cells others prevent production of adenylate cyclase 5 it is unclear how either type of mutation leads to the abnormal movements that occur in this disorder
what are the genetic changes related to adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency,mutations in the aprt gene cause aprt deficiency this gene provides instructions for making aprt an enzyme that helps to convert a dna building block nucleotide called adenine to a molecule called adenosine monophosphate amp this conversion occurs when amp is needed as a source of energy for cells aprt gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormal aprt enzyme with reduced function or prevent the production of any enzyme a lack of functional enzyme impairs the conversion of adenine to amp as a result adenine is converted to another molecule called 28dihydroxyadenine 28dha 28dha crystallizes in urine forming stones in the kidneys and urinary tract 28dha crystals are brownish in color which explains why affected infants frequently have dark urine stains in their diapers 28dha is toxic to kidneys which may explain the possible decline in kidney function and the progression to esrd
what are the genetic changes related to adiposis dolorosa,the cause of adiposis dolorosa is unknown the condition is thought to have a genetic component because a few families with multiple affected family members have been reported however no associated genes have been identified several other possible causes of adiposis dolorosa have been suggested although none have been confirmed they include the use of medications called corticosteroids dysfunction of the endocrine system which produces hormones or changes in the deposition and breakdown of fat adipose tissue metabolism researchers have also suggested that adiposis dolorosa could be an autoimmune disorder which occurs when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the bodys own tissues and organs however there is no firm evidence that the condition is related to abnormal inflammation or other immune system malfunction it is unknown why adiposis dolorosa usually occurs in people who are overweight or obese or why the signs and symptoms do not appear until midadulthood
what are the genetic changes related to adolescent idiopathic scoliosis,the term idiopathic means that the cause of this condition is unknown adolescent idiopathic scoliosis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors studies suggest that the abnormal spinal curvature may be related to hormonal problems abnormal bone or muscle growth nervous system abnormalities or other factors that have not been identified researchers suspect that many genes are involved in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis some of these genes likely contribute to causing the disorder while others play a role in determining the severity of spinal curvature and whether the curve is stable or progressive although many genes have been studied few clear and consistent genetic associations with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis have been identified
what are the genetic changes related to adultonset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia,alsp is caused by mutations in the csf1r gene this gene provides instructions for making a protein called colony stimulating factor 1 receptor csf1 receptor which is found in the outer membrane of certain types of cells including glial cells the csf1 receptor triggers signaling pathways that control many important cellular processes such as cell growth and division proliferation and maturation of the cell to take on specific functions differentiation csf1r gene mutations in alsp lead to an altered csf1 receptor protein that is likely unable to stimulate cell signaling pathways however it is unclear how the gene mutations lead to white matter damage or cognitive and movement problems in people with alsp
what are the genetic changes related to alagille syndrome,in more than 90 percent of cases mutations in the jag1 gene cause alagille syndrome another 7 percent of individuals with alagille syndrome have small deletions of genetic material on chromosome 20 that include the jag1 gene a few people with alagille syndrome have mutations in a different gene called notch2 the jag1 and notch2 genes provide instructions for making proteins that fit together to trigger interactions called notch signaling between neighboring cells during embryonic development this signaling influences how the cells are used to build body structures in the developing embryo changes in either the jag1 gene or notch2 gene probably disrupt the notch signaling pathway as a result errors may occur during development especially affecting the bile ducts heart spinal column and certain facial features
